-- Create partitioned table that does not allow bulk insertions, to test bugs
-- related to the reuse of BulkInsertState across partitions (only done when
-- not using bulk insert).  Switching between partitions often makes it more
-- likely to encounter these bugs, so we just switch on roughly every insert
-- by having an even/odd number partition and inserting evenly distributed
-- data.
