-- set-returning functions that underlie certain system views.
-- The output of most of these functions is very environment-dependent,
-- so our ability to test with fixed expected output is pretty limited /* REPLACED */ ,
-- but even a trivial check of count(*) will exercise the normal code path
-- through the SRF.
